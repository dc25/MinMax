# MinMax

This project implements a tic-tac-toe game using the [minmax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).   The code is based on [this project](https://github.com/MichaelKerekes/Samples) by Mike Kerekes .  The implementations have diverged somewhat.

The project includes both command line and browser based front ends.

The command line front end can be built using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/).

The browser based front end can be built using ghcjs and depends on miso.  See the [miso web page](https://haskell-miso.org/) for instructions on how to install miso.  The miso install will include the ghcjs compiler.

You can try out the browser based verson [here](https://dc25.github.io/MinMax).
