# MinMax

This project implements a tic-tac-toe game using the [minmax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax).   The code is based on [this project](https://github.com/MichaelKerekes/Samples) by Mike Kerekes .  The implementations have diverged somewhat.

Both a command line and a browser based front end exist.   

The command line front end can be built using stack.

The browser based front end can be built using ghcjs and depends on miso.  See the miso web page for instructions on how to install miso.  The miso install will include the ghcjs compiler.

You can try out the browser based verson here.
